# Sign Up Page Project

This project contains two components: a landing page and a sign up page. 

In the Odin Project, the student is told to create just a sign up page. However, since it has been a while since I made a landing page, I wanted to create one that links to the sign up page, like a type landing page would do. This repository contains such results.

Both pages were created for an imaginary Japanese English conversation school called Green Frog.

The sign up page also makes use of the validation constraint API, allowing the user to see if they entered the correct data or not.
